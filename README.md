Practice Problems
CoderyByte_solved.html is Easy Exercises 1 - 30.
CoderByte_solved_MEDIUM.html is Medium Exercises 1- 30.

Majority of the solutions in MEDIUM were written in whole by Will. They are denoted by the comment //WILL
at the start of them.

Most of the solutions for the Easy Exercises were not written in whole by Will. Will attributes this
to the fact that he was still familiarizing himself with array/string methods and regular expressions.

The MEDIUM exercises were actually a lot easier for him. They took him far less time.

Some problems have multiple solutions (recursive, while loop, additional functions defined etc.) listed.
Some of William's notes on programming are commented throughout.
